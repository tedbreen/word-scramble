## Word Scramble

### Minimum requirements:
* Use the [wordnik api](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/words/getRandomWord_get_4) to pick a random word (play around with the api params to get reasonable words)
* Scramble it and show the scrambled word to the user
* Take in keyboard input to type out the unscrambled word (you shouldn't have to use the mouse at all)
* Spend some time on the design and usability (CSS transitions are awesome)
* Try to keep the code simple and clean

### Optional bonus features:
* Supports anagrams (if the "correct" word is "evil" then it should also accept "live" as correct) 
* Phone and tablet support 
* A scoring system or countdown timers 
* A leaderboard
